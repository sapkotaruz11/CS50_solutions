During the experimentation process  I changed different layers of the model as well as their attributes. While using the "same" padding in the convolutional layer (Conv2D) as well as pooling layer(MaxPool2D), the computational expense of the program was high i.e the program took longer to execute without much increase in accuracy. Also, decreasing the number of filters in the convolutional layer too cauesd the decrease in accuracy of the model. Similarly, increasing the size of pool also aided in reduction of accuracy.
During the training process, doubling the no of convolutional layers(con2d->relu->maxpool) from single layer each , increased the accuracy of the model better than adding more convolutional layers than that to the model. Doubling the deep neural layers (Dense, Dropout and Relu) also helped to improve accuracy.
Setting the dropout to 0.3 yeilded more accurate model than setting it at 0.5 without overfitting to the training set as the accuracy of model with testing data  was found to be higher than that of with training data in both the cases.
